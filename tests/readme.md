# Markdown Hashtag Test

## Heading 2

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

> Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

* Showcase or share your work.
* Track and manage changes to your code over time.
* Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
* Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.

*Collaborative working, one of GitHubâ€™s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built.*

**Git is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files. Git is particularly useful when you and a group of people are all making changes to the same files at the same time.**

~~Typically, to do this in a Git-based workflow, you would:~~

* Create a branch off from the main copy of files that you (and your collaborators) are working on.
* Make edits to the files independently and safely on your own personal branch.
* Let Git intelligently merge your specific changes back into the main copy of files, so that your changes don't impact other people's updates.
* Let Git keep track of your and other people's changes, so you all stay working on the most up-to-date version of the project.
